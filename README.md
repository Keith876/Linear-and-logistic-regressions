# Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
## Overview
### Linear Regression
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on their size. The goal is to develop a model that provides accurate price predictions using a single independent variable.
#### Assumptions
1.	A positive linear relationship between house size and price.
2.	Data points represent a fair market value and do not include external influences like location or amenities.
#### Limitations
1.	The model only considers size as a feature and does not account for other factors like location, age, or house condition.
2.	Assumes a linear relationship between size and price, which may not always be valid.


### Logistic Regression
#### Project Overview
It implements a logistic regression model to predict whether a student passes or fails an exam based on the number of hours studied.
#### Limitations
1.	Assumes hours studied is the only factor influencing the outcome.
2.	Does not account for variations in exam difficulty or student aptitude.
